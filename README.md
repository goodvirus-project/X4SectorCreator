# X4 Sector Creator

A tool to help mod new sectors and gate connections in *X4: Foundations*. This tool provides an easy way to create clusters, define sectors within those clusters, and establish gate connections between them. It generates a fully working mod directory with all necessary XML files, making the modding process seamless.

## Features
- Clusters
- Sectors (4 per cluster)
- Gate connections
- Regions (minerals, gases)
- Unique Stations (wharf, shipyard, ..)
- Jobs (ship quotas)
- Factories (products)
- Custom Factions
- Procedural Galaxy Generation

## Installation
1. Go to the releases page of this repository and download the latest release. (https://github.com/Ven0maus/X4SectorCreator/releases)
2. Unpack the compressed zip archive
3. Run the executable file

## Tips and tricks
- You can edit most entries by double clicking on them (clusters, sectors, connections, stations)
- You can right click a gate to rotate it
- You can use right-click hold and drag to resize a region's radius
- You can right-click on a cluster on the map view to quickly move it somewhere else
- Use Export/Import Config to save your setup so you can continue editing it later

## Finishing and installing the mod
1. Press **"Generate MOD"**.
2. A prompt will appear asking for:
   - The **name of your mod folder**. (Subsequently this is the name of your mod)
   - A **unique prefix** to prevent overlap with other mods. (Prefered if you use your name to prevent conflicts with other peoples mods)
3. Press "'Open XML Folder'"

Add the resulting folder of your chosen name in your **gamedirectory/extensions folder** and enable it in-game to see the results.
